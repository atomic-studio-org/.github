## How to contribute to Atomic Studio

Basically just contribute to this project just like you would with any other, but make sure to follow [these guidelines](https://justsimply.dev/) when writing documentation of any type.

We also really like [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Nushell](https://nushell.sh/) in this project, so make sure to have these installed on your system and run `nix flake check` before commiting to make sure your changes comply with style and linting guidelines for our project


Atomic Studio is meant to be a method of getting software you want on your system, and we usually prefer Open Source software whenever possible, but there really is no issue in using Proprietary Software when necessary, just make sure to prioritize any FOSS software. 

Thanks you very much for contributing to Atomic Studio!
